Product Description:
The aim of this project is to develop an e-commerce website where people associated with Monmouth University can buy/sell products and services for people who registered in this website. 
This e-commerce website will facilitate registered users to post any product or service that they wish to sell by login into this portal. Users can search for products desired to purchase by entering their search criteria in this website home page. This returns the list of all the products that meet the user entered search criteria. Users shall be able to buy any of these products as long as they logged into the portal. If users not registered, they can do so at any point of time in the registration page. If the logged-in users don't find anything meeting their search criteria, they can request on this portal to be notified via email when new postings are added on this website that meet the users purchase criteria. This website also enforces only people associated with Monmouth University to be registered by mandating users to enter Monmouth's email id during registration. A unique registration code will be sent to their respective Monmouth email id's using which users can confirm their registration in the verification page. Any logged-in user can view all the products purchased and all the postings made by the user on this website.
